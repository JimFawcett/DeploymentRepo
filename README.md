# DeploymentRepo
Demonstration code for DeployBites

Contents are small demonstration codes for <a href="https://jimfawcett.github.io/indexDeployment.html">Deployment Track</a> for
<a href="https://jimfawcett.github.io/index.html">JimFawcett github website</a>.

### Note:<br />
This repository contains a folder, GitDemoRust, that contains zipped git repositories for small demos about git. Git and github
complain about git repositories within a parent repository. Git modules and subtrees are the official mechanism for handling this,
but that complicates cloning and pushing so I opted for this approach.

DeploymentRepo will eventually contain additional folders with other kinds of demonstration code.
